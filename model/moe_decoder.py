moe_decoder.py — Soft-routing Mixture-of-Experts decoder

Refines the temporal hidden state (B, D, H, W) into a decoded feature
map (B, D, H, W) using a blend of N expert decoders, where the blend
weights are computed per-pixel from the input features.

Architecture:
    Input: state  (B, D, H, W)

    Router:
        Global average pool → (B, D)
        Linear → (B, n_experts)
        Softmax → routing weights  (B, n_experts)
        # Global routing: one weight set per sample (not per-pixel).
        # Keeps routing stable and interpretable.

    Experts (n_experts=4):
        Each expert is a small residual ConvNet:
            Conv 3×3 → GroupNorm → GELU → Conv 3×3 → GroupNorm
            + residual connection
        Experts share the same architecture but have independent weights.

    Output:
        Weighted sum of expert outputs: Σ w_e * expert_e(state)
        (B, D, H, W)

Why global routing (not per-pixel)?
    Per-pixel routing produces a different expert blend at every spatial
    location. In practice this makes the router unstable — small input
    perturbations cause large routing changes, and experts collapse to
    identical functions (the "expert collapse" problem).
    Global routing (one set of weights per sample) is more stable,
    still regime-adaptive (different samples can route differently),
    and interpretable: you can inspect which expert activates for which
    regime after training.

Why 4 experts?
    Matching the 4 dominant Bay of Bengal oceanographic regimes:
    pre-monsoon (Mar–May), summer monsoon (Jun–Sep),
    post-monsoon (Oct–Nov), winter (Dec–Feb).
    This is a soft prior — the model isn't forced to use one expert per
    regime, but the capacity is there if the routing learns it.

Expert collapse prevention:
    - Load-balancing auxiliary loss (call compute_aux_loss() during training)
      penalises routing weight entropy collapse (all samples → one expert).
    - Router input uses global average pooled features, which are more
      stable than local features.
    - Experts use residual connections so they start near the identity
      and diverge gradually during training.
